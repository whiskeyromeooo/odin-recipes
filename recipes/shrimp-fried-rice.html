        <h1>Shrimp Fried Rice</h1>
        <h3>Description: </h3>
        <p>Shrimp Fried Rice is one of my go-to 30-minute meals and my family can’t get enough of it. Shrimp and rice loaded with veggies and egg is a protein-packed and easy dinner. Fried rice is the best way to use leftover cooked rice.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients: </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 Cups of at least a day old rice (refrigerated works best)</li>
            <li>15-20 pcs raw Shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
            <li>Mixed Vegetables (I use the frozen ones for convenience)</li>
            <li>2-3 Eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>Green Onions chopped</li>
            <li>Either Soy or Oyster Sauce (soy for authenticity, but personally I like oyster sauce better)</li>
            <li>Sesame Oil (optional, but this makes the dish more authentic)</li>
            <li>Garlic, half a head and chopped</li>
            <li>White Onion, 1 bulb and chopped</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper to taste</li>
            <li>Canola Oil for cooking</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Steps: </h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the shrimp on medium-high heat, about a minute per side, then set a side (be careful not to overcook or they might get rubbery)</li>
            <li>Pour eggs into the hot pan and scramble until it's no longer runny, set aside</li>
            <li>Sauté garlic, onions, and green onions (leave a bit for garnishing)</li>
            <li>After a few seconds, add in the first half of your rice (cooking the rice in batches makes the fried rice less oily)</li>
            <li>Add your mixed veggies, and the rest of your rice along with it</li>
            <li>Add 2-3 tbsps of oyster or soy sauce, keep stir-frying on high heat</li>
            <li>Add the cooked shrimp and eggs you set aside a while ago, and you can now serve it with a bit of green onions on top</li>
        </ol>
