# Odin Recipes

Hi! I'm WR, and this is a project I made (or am making) to provide a handy list of recipes for everyone to use and enjoy.

## Skills to Learn in this Project

I expect to be able to learn how to make a useful and meaningful README for my future projects.

I also plan on using this project as a means to practice using and understanding GitHub fully.
